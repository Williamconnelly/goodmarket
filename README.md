## Description
Stunnel is a website that bring people around the world together through buying and selling each others products. The exciting thing about this website, however, is that sellers and donate to their charity of choice if they sell something.

## User Stories
A user can view the main page as well as the market page which shows all the items on the market being sold. A user can login or sign up to buy or sell an item. If a user wants to sell an item they can decide to donate a portion of their earnings to a charity as well as deciding which charity to donate to. A user who wants to purchase an item can view where the seller is donating to and how much the seller is donating. Each user has a cart they can add items to. A user can navigate to their cart and view their items, the total cost, and a button to checkout their purchases.
